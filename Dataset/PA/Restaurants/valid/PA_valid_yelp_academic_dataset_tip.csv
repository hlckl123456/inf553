A69QAmKSdW45kUIqd4FESg,Ordered medium burger and it came out rare. I had already cut it in half. I sent it back And asked for a new fresh burger. When I received the burger it was the same one I cut in half. If this is a burger joint they should not reheat burgers as you lose the juices. Very disappointing.,iRhB506lbc0kU5289zyHzg,0,2012-11-14

Ambiance sitting outside was pretty nice, service was pretty slow/bordering on inattentive, food-while portions were small it was overall  pretty tasty. For apps, we got chips & salsa and 2 kinds of serviche.  The best sauce was the red - smoky & good. Serviche 2 ways = disappointment x2. Very small portions.

I ordered the linguini and white clam sauce for my entree and it was absolutely delicious! My friends had veal Parmesan, and penne with barb's pomodoro sauce, which were equally adored. The only drawbacks were the gelato, which was good, but too expensive in our opinion, and the bitter coffee. Overall, we were very pleased! :)",kzbH1_l7VTSfFFcwTqY6vA,0,2013-07-24

73mPy0pv3grD5uq_6oRGzQ,Has good food!!! Personally think the menu is too big for one short ordered cook to handle. Something is always late or wrong. Everytime that I go there is always only one waitress on. Not enough for the amount of business that goes in. For ex. There are 31 guests in the diner right now for one girl & one cook. Good food is you like to wait & have to hope it will be right. It's too bad there isn't another place to go in the area.,dDLRhywKVjnSIFe4H5tu_w,0,2013-05-10

The ownership may have changed and the interior does look much nicer with updates and an added bar area but nothing else has improved. 

Barbie still makes the tiny toast, the so called ""home fries"" are Ore Ida frozen potato cubes ( we call them bag & spoon fries) and the overall portion sizes and quality is not good at all.

On top of that my father's burger was extremely overcooked and tasted extremely salty. The fries were also re-cooked. We had two glasses of wine and a beer and the total of all three drinks was $29. A little pricey for a sports bar in Pittsburgh if you ask me. Also the communication between the manager and the servers was poor.
